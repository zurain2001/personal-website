  I love creating new things, and in college I found my passion in developing new applications through software.
  I am proficient in Python, Java, HTML, SQL and C++ and I have experience in using tools
  such as Jupyter Notebooks and Excel for data analysis, Tableau for data visualizations and
  different machine learning models as well.

  I enjoy travelling and in my free time I love to do photography and making short videos. 
  I post my photographs and short films on my Instagram page @zurainzeeshan.
